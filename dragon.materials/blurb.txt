Re: Dragon

Something went dreadfully wrong in last year's IFFComp. Now a diabolical lawyer representing a cabal of angry dragons threatens to sue the Interactive Fiction Technological Freedom Foundation into oblivion over content on the IFFComp website. 

Armed only with email, can you, George MacBraeburn, chief administrator of the IFTFF, find a solution that will save the competition and the Foundation itself?

Strap on your meta-goggles.

Note: I would like to make it clear that while another IFcomp story is referenced in the current work, I am not the author of that previous story.
